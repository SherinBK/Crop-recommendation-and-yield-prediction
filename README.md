# Crop-recomendation-and-yield-prediction

The project aims to recommend the suitable crop that can be grown in any district of tamil nadu considering the climatic conditions collected using Open Weather API and soil fertility details from the user. We also intend to predict the yield of the particular crop to help the cultivators stay prepared.

Clasiificatoion algorithms are implemented to conclude the best crop to be cultivated considering the factors, the soil's mineral content ratios and weather conditions.
A regression algorithm is then used to predict the approx. yield that can be expected considering the season of cultivation, crop type, area of land and district of cultivation.

Both the models are then brought together to get the soil details from the users and present weather conditions from the API to predict the best suitable crop and also its approx. yield.
